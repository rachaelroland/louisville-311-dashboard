**Q3: "Does this include animal metro services? Are there questions about adoption?"**
- Analyzed animal-related requests: 6,288 total
- Categories: Animal cruelty/neglect, noise complaints, loose animals
- Adoption mentions: Only 18 out of 169,598 (0.01%)
- Conclusion: Dataset is about complaints, not adoption services

**Q4: "Do we know the source of each 311 row? As in phone, email, etc?"**
- Analyzed source field (column 10 in raw CSV)

## Meta Lessons Learned

### FastHTML Dashboard Development
**Success:** Leveraged existing Zendesk annotation app patterns
- Same framework (FastHTML) reduces learning curve
- Bootstrap 5 for consistent professional styling
- Plotly integration for interactive charts
- Component-based approach for maintainability

**Key Learning:** Reusing proven architecture patterns accelerates development
- Navigation component reused from Zendesk app
- Chart generation follows same pattern
- Route structure mirrors annotation app
- One-click launcher script for easy testing

### Data Analysis Insights
**Discovery:** Source field analysis revealed business opportunity
- Original question: "Do we know the source?"
- Finding: 62.9% use call center, 43.2% unknown
- Insight: This is a signal, not just metadata
- Outcome: Identified $125K savings opportunity

**Key Learning:** Always ask "what does this tell us about behavior?"
- Metadata fields can reveal user preferences
- High call center usage = opportunity for self-service
- Data gaps (blank sources) indicate collection issues

### NER for Metadata Enrichment
**Experiment:** Can NER fill in blank source fields?
- Attempted to infer contact method from entities
- Result: Only 1.3% coverage (821 of 62,967 blanks)
- Finding: NER finds contact details but not original channel

**Key Learning:** NER is supplementary, not a substitute for proper data collection
- Named entities != data provenance
- Improve source tracking at intake
- Don't rely on inference for critical metadata

### Business Impact Communication
**Success:** Translated technical findings into business value
- Sentiment analysis → Customer satisfaction issues
- Urgency classification → Resource allocation gaps
- Topic modeling → Strategic priorities
- NSR analysis → $125K cost savings opportunity

**Key Learning:** Always connect data to dollars and decisions
- Every insight should have an action
- Quantify impact in financial terms
- Provide concrete implementation roadmap
- Make recommendations specific and measurable
