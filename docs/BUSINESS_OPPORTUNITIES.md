## The Problem: NSR Metro Agencies (35,000 calls/year)

Our deep dive into the largest category reveals these are primarily:

**Sample caller inquiries:**
- "Advised it is collected every other week" (recycling schedule question)
- "Garbage cart was stolen, wanted replacement" (cart order)
- "Called to report garbage was missed" (status check)
- "Was advised the guidelines for collection" (policy question)
- "Phone number given to Solid Waste" (simple referral)
- "Question about free radon test kit" (information request)

**Only 0.5% have meaningful descriptions** - the rest are one-sentence inquiries that could be:
- Answered by FAQ
- Handled by chatbot
- Automated via IVR
- Submitted via web form
